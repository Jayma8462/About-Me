    <h2>A Little About Myself</h2>
    <p class="text">I grew up as a navy kid with my father serving 20+ years. My family of 9 people (7 kids), eventually settled in Bremerton </br>
    after my father retired. Due to injury I learned my work ethic from my mother who worked hard to provide what all of us needed.</br>
    Most of the skills I learned through life was from my mother and she is a very good teacher. Watching my father growing up it was installed</br>
    into me early that I needed to serve my country so after I graduated High School I joined the Marine Corps instead of following my fathers</br>
    footsteps and joining the Navy.</p>
    <p class="text">During my time in the Marine Corps it was difficult to gain a foothold and find my place, when I did find my place I was promoted to E-4 while</br>
    I was still in school for Windows Server Administrator. When I hit my unit we deployed fairly quickly where I worked with many high ranking</br>
    officers and had to learn to be nice to users that I worked with on a daily basis. After getting various job offers through the years I had</br>
    jumped around many different jobs learning many new skills and I found interest in many different things.</p>
    <p class="text">Currently I work as a Sharepoint Developer where I build small scripts to fix settings and push other security patches to systems</br>
    that did not update appropriately. Simple scripting kiddy unfortunately. In the last few years I have been trying many new things, for example I decided</br>
    to learn to snowboard and picked up cooking. I have many animals to include 2 cats and a dog that I adopted a few years ago. I love animals because I</br>
    spent a few years on a farm when I grew up to help my Great Grandmother when she was unable to move as easily. I enjoy Paintball, I am out on the</br>
    field almost every weekend when I am not out playing some disk golf. I enjoy paintball because there are many new players and I love teaching them</br>
    what I know about the game. Specially they get bragging rights with their friends when they eliminate them.</p>
    <p class="text">From the many years the things that I enjoy the most is learning something new. As of late I have focused my efforts into coding</br>
    where I picked up a good number of languages, most of them are entry level, but I enjoy it for the ever changing world. There is always someone</br>
    who has come out with a new idea, a better one and I love to learn the new concepts so I can build my own projects. I learned so many languages</br>
    based out of need for the many projects over the years. Most of the projects were things I needed to complete for people or for myself but ultimately</br>
    I found it outright fun, creating something from a blank canvas. I look forward to learning more in the future and hopefully I will learn something new</br>
    that I can apply to my future endeavors.</p>
    <p class="text">Lastly, I do not like sports although I was part of the Wrestling, Swimming, Soccer and Basketball teams in High School.</br>
    I only watch the Superbowl or the World Cup for the awesome commercials. But I do quite a bit of Photography both action and portrait, I am </br>
    pretty good at capturing people at the exact moment to show what they are feeling naturally. I dont like staged photos like in a studio, I am good at</br>
    getting great photos of people when they are showing the emotions of the games I.E. Sad at a bad play, Excited during awesome plays and many others.</br>
    Another fun fact about me that I should learn you with is that I also know how to play 7 different instruments. I learned to love good music because my mother</br>
    played piano every day of my young life and I wanted to learn so I can enjoy the music too.</p>
